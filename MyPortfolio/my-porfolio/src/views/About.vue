            Hey there, I'm Grady, a student based in geelong with a joy for web
            design and network engineering. I enjoy working on design operations
            and systems that help bring order to complexity. When i'm not
            working and have free time, you'll probably find me playing a varity
            of games whilst socialising online with my mates and in the company
            of my cat Babushka. Here's a photo of her.
